## Installation

You can install this package with `pip install nanotts`.

## Usage

The NanoTTS python wrapper provides two methods to generate speech, one from a string input, the other from a text file.

ntts = nanotts.NanoTTS()

# Generate speech from a string
ntts.speaks("Hello World!")

# Generate speech from a text file
ntts.speak("input.txt")
```
